At **NetSci 2024, Quebec**, I was honored with the **Best Presentation Award** by an early career researcher.

It is always exciting to spend time with old and new friends at NetSci and Iâ€™m very grateful for the recognition and support from the network science community. Below you can also have a look at my final poem!
