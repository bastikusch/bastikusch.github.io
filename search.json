I hold a B.Sc. in Simulation Technology and a M.Sc. in Environmental Modelling.\nMy research focuses on emergent complex systems described by multiple mechanisms, aiming to develop mathematical frameworks to distinguish between their causal effects on observed structural patterns using methods from Network Science, Complex Systems, Bayesian Statistics and Algorithmic Information Theory."
